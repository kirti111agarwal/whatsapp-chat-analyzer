Priyanshi this side,

Sunny sir mentored me from 2019-2020.

Well, I have always been interested in the creative field. So I graduated in Bachelors of Fashion Designing and Management and am now a designer in KASA. 
I have had pleasure to meet various TV stars, actresses, which further gave me an opportunity to do Freelancing as a Stylist, wardrobe consultant and Fashion Event Management as well. 

I am planning to pursue Higher studies in Fashion in the coming future.

I am happy to be part of the community and help to guide anyone interested to join a similar field as mine üòä
[21/04/2025, 22:46:26] Shria: Hello everyone!
I am Shria Agrawal, sir's student from the year 2016-2017. 
I am from management background. Completed bba from KUSOM and mba from Kings College Nepal. I worked at Outreach Nepal (Nepal's leading advertising agency) as Account Supervisor for Unilever Nepal's portfolio for 2.5 years. 
Then, moved on to working as a marketing executive for a tech company Awecode Solutions and have now begun my own venture for bags. With about 4 years of experience in the field of marketing now, anyone interested in the field of ads and marketing, msg me anytime! 
Since everyone is sharing their tuition groups name, ours was actually different, it was "U hv this 1 lyf, mk urself proud" something which became my life mantraüòá

[11/06/2025, 21:17:21] Aryan: Hi everyone 
I'm Aryan, one of the students of sunny sir. Sir taught me from 2018 to 2020 
I have a small story to share, I had flunked my grade 11 in KV in 2017 and joined Rai school 2018 when I met sunny sir.
I worked throughout 2 years and got through, it might be a smooth sailing for most of you but was not for me.
Then I joined TIET to pursue mechanical engineering and worked with ISRO in the propulsion division.
Got a placement at Tata motors where I worked with the operations team and design team. 
Had been preparing for GATE since my final year.
And recently got an admit from IIT ROORKEE.
Please feel free to ask any questions about my preparation or my research projects would love to answer them.
[11/06/2025, 21:20:43] Sunny Sir: So proud of you aryan....journey to IIT was not easy ,I know..
And I still remember those days....God bless u

[01/05/2025, 21:16:31] Aditi Jhaüòé‚ú®: We can connect through Google meet or zoom call on weekend so everyone can introduce themselves and find common purpose or motivation in the person to interact easily!!
[02/05/2025, 01:41:49] Jatin Chaudhary: I have been getting DMs sir, interacting via meet/zoom is also possible.
[02/05/2025, 07:06:23] Narayan Agrawal: Instead of making groups based on batches, we could try grouping people based on common interests. Like, if someone is into startups or already building something, they can be in the same group with others who are also interested in startups. That way, they can share value, learn from each other, and connect over something they‚Äôre all passionate about. Makes the group more engaging and useful too!
